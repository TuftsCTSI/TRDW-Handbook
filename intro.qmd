# Introduction

This is a user facing manual for the Tufts Research Data Warehouse ("TRDW")

# Projects Best Suited for TRDW
![Source:  https://www.ohdsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SOS-challenge-intro-24jan2023.pdf](AnalyticUseCases.bmp) 

Different IRB forms may be used depending on the project characteristics.

<!-- Note to Clark, perhaps none of this belongs here as it is someone else's turf so I will let you decide.
## What We Do
The TRDW team offers a consultation service to Tufts School of Medicine researchers on topics related to biomedical informatics and clinical data access for research. Informaticists work with you to refine your research question, if necessary, and advise on the appropriate IRB pathway. We then provide you with a data extraction plan to meet your research needs.

## When to connect with us
Researchers are encouraged to contact us early in the study design process and long before protocol finalization and submission to the IRB.

## Service Costs
TBD
Up to one hour of free consultation is subsidized by the Tufts University School of Medicine XXX. Custom research data extracts for research are offered on a fee-for-service basis.-->

## When to include TRDW staff as members of the study team
TBD
<!-- Note for Clark: The following comes from PMAP language I already had, but I wasn't sure what was the appropriate answer from Tufts policy standpoint.  TRDW staff should be included as members of the study team in eIRB if they are making substantial contributions to the work. Discuss any plans to include TRDW staff on the study team with the staff in question.-->

## Sensitive Data
<!-- Note for Clark:need to make sure this is all accurate - pulling from previous work -->
Sensitive data, including psychotherapy notes, substance abuse data, and HIV data, have special legal protections. Therefore, they are excluded by default from standard TRDW projections.

The following types of data are classified as sensitive:
- Notes from mental health or substance abuse professionals
- Diagnoses related to mental health, substance abuse, or HIV
- Medication orders for mental health, substance abuse, or HIV (specifically for these conditions)
- HIV test results

You can include sensitive data in your TRDW projection if you provide appropriate scientific justification in the IRB-approved study protocol.

Ensure that sensitive data is explicitly described in the protocol and specifically requested in your data request.

Be aware that the definition of sensitive data may evolve over time with the development of new drugs and new applications for existing drugs and tests.

The TRDW team will continuously update data projection restrictions to align with the latest definitions of sensitive data.


## The Collaboration Process
<!-- Note for Clark: I realize this isn't completely accurate but wanted to get us started with the outline. -->

## Describing TRDW Data and Data Management in your IRB application.
<!-- Note for Clark:need your input on what IRB has said.  Perhaps we should co-author this with IRB? If you have a contact I can work with them on it. 

## Working with Notebooks
TBD

# Publishing your work
-add language about CTSI which is supposed to be mentioned
-publishing your notebooks as a supplement

# CTSI OMOP Data Export
## General Documentation for Researchers Receiving Exported OMOP CDM Subset
This document provides guidance on using a subset of Tufts electronic health record data in OMOP CDM format. If you are looking for information on how to request your own data set, review this guidance. <!-- Note for Clark:  Is there a page to data request process similar to: (https://ctsi.wakehealth.edu/service/data-and-design/data-extraction)?  I see this page: (https://www.tuftsctsi.org/research-services/informatics/) -->

### Understanding Your OMOP Data Subset
You have received a zip file containing several tables in .csv format. This data subset is derived from the Tufts CTSI <!-- Note for Clark:[insert official name]--> OMOP database which follows the conventions of OMOP 5.3 CDM. A comprehensive data dictionary is available here: [OMOP CDM v5.3](https://ohdsi.github.io). While the documentation for 5.3 applies to this subset, note that your data are a subset of the larger Tufts CTSI OMOP database and therefore the OHDSI software tool stack cannot be used on your subset.

### What you received in your data package
You will receive a notebook and several data files (see below)
The notebook is a ....(see screen shots below)

The data subset is provided in several CSV files. An exported data inventory typically includes:
1. OMOP.ZIP which has one CSV per OMOP table 
2. keyfile.csv: maps person_id to MRNs
3. timeline.zip: all events by person, event type, event id, and time <!-- Note for Clark: when I obtain access to the Box I will be able to describe this further.-->

### Tables 
<!-- Note for Clark:  This is a placeholder based on the code I shared with me as it is not clear if the researcher receives all files.  To be updated when I have access to Box and can take a proper inventory -->

# Commonly Used CDM Tables Overview
The OMOP common data model (CDM) is a relational database made up of different tables that relate to each other by foreign keys (XXXX_ID values; e.g., PERSON_ID or PROVIDER_ID). The OMOP tables in your data export are as follows:

| Table              | Description |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Person             | Contains basic demographic information describing a participant, including biological sex, birth date, race, and ethnicity. |
| Visit_occurrence   | Captures encounters with healthcare providers or similar events. Contains the type of visit a person has (outpatient care, inpatient care, or long-term care), as well as the date and duration information. Rows in other tables can reference this table, for example, condition_occurrences related to a specific visit. |
| Condition_occurrence | Indicates the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or symptom, which is either observed by a provider or reported by the patient. |
| Drug_exposure      | Captures records about the utilization of a medication. Drug exposures include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as drugs. Drug exposure is inferred from clinical events associated with orders, prescriptions written, pharmacy dispensing, procedural administrations, and other patient-reported information. |
| Measurement        | Contains both orders and results of a systematic and standardized examination or testing of a participant or participant's sample, including laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. |
| Procedure_occurrence | Contains records of activities or processes ordered by or carried out by a healthcare provider on the patient to have a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose. |
| Observation        | Captures clinical facts about a person obtained in the context of an examination, questioning, or a procedure. Any data that cannot be represented by another domain, such as social and lifestyle facts, medical history, and family history, are recorded here. |
| Device_exposure    | Captures information about a person's exposure to a foreign physical object or instrument which is used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Devices include implantable objects, blood transfusions, medical equipment and supplies, other instruments used in medical procedures, and material used in clinical care. |
| Death              | Contains the clinical events surrounding how and when a participant dies. |


### Privacy Considerations

The TRDW's deidentified data sets use time-shifting, see @pmid27013522.
<!-- Note for Clark:  Any policies or considerations we should alert them to regarding the use of MRNs? 

### Opening and analyzing the data
Are there any requirements about where they can open and use the files? E.g. At JHU they need to use “SAFE Desktop.”

### Hardware
<!-- Note for Clark:  Should we comment on recommended hardware/computing environment? -->

### Software
<!-- Note for Clark: Do we assume that they will not want to reassemble the files into a relational database like MS SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc? -->

<!--
### Identifiers, primary and foreign keys
[Data Model Conventions], including information on Concept vs Source (https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/dataModelConventions.html)
Not sure if they receive PHI, source fields, but here would discuss how to look up MRNs from person_id keyfile

<!-- Note to Clark:  Can we make an entity relationship diagram to show how the ids in the tables are connected? -->


<!-- Note to Clark: 
I am also working on FAQs and can make some sample R code, below. I also recommend having them meet with me for an hour if helpful.  I do not mind at all.
### FAQ
- **Can I use OHDSI software?**
  No, because the tables do not represent all of the tables necessary to successfully use tools. However, you can still take advantage of the OMOP CDM structure.
  
- **What do I do if I get stuck?**
  Reach out to Danielle w/ questions.-->

## Analysis with SQL

The [OMOP Query Library](https://data.ohdsi.org/QueryLibrary/) is a library of commonly-used SQL queries for the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM).


## Analysis with R
Below are some sample R queries that demonstrate how to read in OMOP tables from CSV files, join them based on the `person_id` and `visit_occurrence_id` fields, and search for specific criteria.

Note: Adjust the file paths and column names accordingly based on the actual structure and location of your CSV files. The queries below are a generic representation and may need adjustments based on the specifics of your data set.

### Reading CSV files into R data frames:

```R
# Read the CSV files into R data frames
person_df <- read.csv("path_to_person_table.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
visit_occurrence_df <- read.csv("path_to_visit_occurrence_table.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
condition_occurrence_df <- read.csv("path_to_condition_occurrence_table.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```
Join tables based on `person_id`:

When a person has multiple visits in the `visit_occurrence` table, joining the `person` table with the `visit_occurrence` table will result in multiple rows for that person, each corresponding to a different visit. This is a standard one-to-many join operation.

```R
## Join person with visit_occurrence on 'person_id'
person_visit_df <- merge(person_df, visit_occurrence_df, by="person_id")
```

### Joining the Person-Visit table with the Condition Occurrence table:

```R
# Join the person-visit result with condition_occurrence on both 'person_id' and 'visit_occurrence_id'
full_df <- merge(person_visit_df, condition_occurrence_df, by=c("person_id", "visit_occurrence_id"))
```

### Search by a list of `person_ids`:

```R
# Define a list of person_ids to search for
search_person_ids <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Filter the data frame to only include rows with person_ids in the list
filtered_by_person_df <- subset(full_df, person_id %in% search_person_ids)
```

### Search by a specific condition concept code:

```R
# Define a specific condition concept code to search for
search_condition_concept_id <- 1234567

# Filter the data frame to only include rows with the specified condition concept code
filtered_by_condition_df <- subset(full_df, condition_concept_id == search_condition_concept_id)
```

### Search by a date range:

```R
# Define a date range to search for
start_date <- as.Date("2020-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2020-12-31")

## Filter the data frame to only include rows within the date range
filtered_by_date_df <- subset(full_df, visit_start_date >= start_date & visit_start_date <= end_date)
```
<!--TBD
## Analysis with Python 

### Required Python Libraries:

To execute the Python queries, you'll need to install the pandas library. -->
